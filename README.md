<h2>‚ú® Description</h2>  
<p align="justify">  
The <b>Chest Disease Detection using Deep Learning (R-CNN)</b> project utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to automate the detection and classification of chest diseases from X-ray images.<br>  
By leveraging the Faster R-CNN architecture and transfer learning, the system assists radiologists in diagnosing conditions like pneumonia, tuberculosis, and lung cancer with improved accuracy and efficiency.<br>  
The project employs the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, a large and annotated dataset, for robust model training and evaluation.
